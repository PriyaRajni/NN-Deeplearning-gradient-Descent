Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used in deep learning to minimize the loss function and improve the accuracy of a model. 
The primary goal of training a neural network is to find the optimal values of weights and biases that reduce the difference between the predicted and actual outputs. 
Gradient Descent helps achieve this by iteratively adjusting the model parameters.
